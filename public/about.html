<p>Hello! I'm Vitaly Kim, a 37-year-old entrepreneur with a successful flooring renovation and repair business. While I've achieved a lot in the flooring industry, I've developed a strong passion and motivation for diving into the world of web development.</p>

<p>My experience as a flooring specialist has honed essential skills
 like time management, materials and cost estimates, 
 problem-solving, teamwork, attention to detail, and personal 
 responsibility for project success. I'm excited to redirect 
 these skills into the tech realm and embark on a journey of 
 learning and growth to become a proficient web developer.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm a lively individual who enjoys outdoor
 activities, working out, cooking, and karaoke. I'm also a 
  father of two amazing sons, aged 6 and 4, and love spending 
  quality time playing with them.</p>

<p>Let's connect and create something awesome together!</p>
